# MF-BML

A general Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Machine Learning framework: from data scarce to large data set

---

### **Summary**

This repo provides provide a general Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Machine Learning framework. The developed MF-BML framework can be used to handle both data scarce and large data set scenario depending on the employed algorithm within the framework. Although the developed MF-BML framework doesn't restrict any algorithm, two configurations are recommended in this repo for handling data scarce and large data set problems respectively.
